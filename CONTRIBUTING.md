# Contribution Guidelines

* All exploits must be tested and reliable all of the time. No shitty "works on my box" bullshit like certain other people. If an exploit does not work, file an issue so that can be fixed ASAP.
* All exploits must be accompanied by a demo: asciicast, screenshot, or video are acceptable.
* No fucking ruby because I cannot be arsed reading ruby, and because the version issues/backwards compatibility is worse than Python2/Python3. Seriously. Python and Perl are preferred. Lisp, Scheme, FORTRAN, COBOL, REXX, and other fun languages are also highly appreciated.
* Don't take this too seriously. It is not official policy, or representative of anything except the authors thoughts and feelings on exploit development.
